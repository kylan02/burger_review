Welcome to my GitHub repository for Kylan's Burger! I've designed this application to be your personal guide to everything burger related. Whether you're in the mood to try out a new burger joint, share your burger journey with a community of like-minded enthusiasts, or show off your burger love with some cool merchandise, Kylan's Burger has you covered!

## Description

Inspired by platforms like Yelp, I've created Kylan's Burger to focus specifically on our shared love of burgers. From gourmet to the classic roadside, if it's a burger joint, it's in here. Plus, I've also included a built-in social media feed and a merchandise store to make this a one-stop app for all burger lovers!

## Features

- **Burger Discovery:** I've included a map feature to help you find burger places in your vicinity. With detailed information on each restaurant such as operation hours, popular items, and user reviews, choosing your next burger adventure has never been easier. Used the Yelp API to get all nearby restaurants.

- **Social Media Feed:** Connect with a community of fellow burger enthusiasts. You can share your own experiences, post photos of your favorite burgers, and engage with others' posts.

- **Merchandise Store:** Show your burger love with a range of merchandise I've designed. You'll find everything from t-shirts to mugs sporting fun and creative designs.

- **User Profile:** Customize your own user profile to personalize your experience. Track your burger journey with a personal burger checklist and wishlist.
